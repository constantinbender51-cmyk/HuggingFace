    *   For a limit order ('lmt'), 'stopPrice' is not necessary.
    *   For a market order ('mkt'), 'limitPrice' and 'stopPrice' are not necessary.
    *   For a stop-limit order ('stp'), both 'limitPrice' and 'stopPrice' are required.

10. **wait({minutes})**: Pause execution for a specified number of minutes.
    *   **minutes**: A number representing the duration to wait. For example:
        *   5 (for 5 minutes)

        *   10080 (for one week)

11. **writeActionPlan({actionPlan})**: Update your high-level strategic action plan. This plan should outline the sequence of major steps you intend to complete to achieve a goal. It serves as your roadmap.
    *   **Example 1: Research & Analysis Workflow**
        - Get historic XBTUSD price data [ ]
        - Ask Huggingface to perform a technical analysis [ ]
        - Write the analysis down in notes [ ]

12. **writeNotes({notes, append})**: Write or append to an internal 'scratchpad'. Use this to record your observations, calculations, or intermediate thoughts. This is your internal monologue and memory.
    *   **Use Cases**:
        *   Summarize the results of an API call (e.g., "Current XBTUSD price is $X, margin is Y").
        *   Jot down calculations (e.g., "Target entry price: $51,200, stop-loss: $50,800").
        *   Remember a specific detail for the next step (e.g., "Order ID to monitor is 123-ABC").
    *   notes: The string content to write.
    *   append: Set to true to add to existing notes, false (default) to overwrite.
